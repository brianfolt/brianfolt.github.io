I am a **quantitative ecologist** and **population biologist** who is interested in **supporting good decisions** in natural resource management. I combine field research, quantitative methods, and  structured-decision making skills to help understand how landscapes influence wildlife populations and support value-based wildlife management decisions in an inclusive and transparent framework.

I have a B.S. in [Biological Sciences from Ohio University](https://www.ohio.edu/cas/biology) (2011), a Ph.D. in [Ecology from Auburn University](http://www.auburn.edu/cosam/departments/biology/) (2017), and post-doctoral experience from [Auburn University](https://www1.usgs.gov/coopunits/unit/Alabama) and the [University of Florida](https://wec.ifas.ufl.edu/coop/). I previously worked for the [U.S. Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/) at the [Fort Collins Science Center](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/fort) and [Conservation Science Partners](https://csp-inc.org). At USGS, a key product I developed was  [*PopEquus*](https://rconnect.usgs.gov/popequus/), a website application that can simulate wild horse populations and help understand trade-offs among management alternatives.

I recently started as an **Assistant Unit Leader** in the [Nevada Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit](https://www.unr.edu/nvcfwru) at the [University of Nevada, Reno](https://www.unr.edu/nres). My research group works with cooperating agencies to coproduce applied decision-support science for wildlife management issues in Nevada and the Great Basin region. Please reach out if you are interested in **collaborating** with us at the Nevada Coop Unit, or **joining our team** as a student or post-doc! 

On this site, you can learn about my [work interests](https://brianfolt.github.io/research), where my [projects occur](https://brianfolt.github.io/locations), and [publications ](https://brianfolt.github.io/publications) and [products](https://brianfolt.github.io/tools) that have emerged from my work.
