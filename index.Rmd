I am a **quantitative ecologist** and **wildlife biologist** who is interested in **supporting good decisions** in natural resource management. I combine field research, quantitative methods, and  structured-decision making skills to understand system dynamics and guide wildlife management decisions in a transparent and inclusive framework. I have a B.S. in [Biological Sciences from Ohio University](https://www.ohio.edu/cas/biology) (2011), a Ph.D. in [Ecology from Auburn University](http://www.auburn.edu/cosam/departments/biology/) (2017), and post-doctoral experience from the Alabama and Florida Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Units at [Auburn University](https://www1.usgs.gov/coopunits/unit/Alabama) and the [University of Florida](https://wec.ifas.ufl.edu/coop/). 

I currently work as an ecologist for the [U.S. Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/) at the [Fort Collins Science Center](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/fort), where I am building tools to support management decisions for feral horse populations (i.e., 'wild horses') in the United States. I recently developed [*PopEquus*](https://rconnect.usgs.gov/popequus/), a modeling application that can be used to understand trade-offs in wild horse population management. We hope to make *PopEquus* available to the public by October 2022.
