I am a **quantitative ecologist** and **wildlife biologist** who is interested in **supporting good decisions** in natural resource management. I combine field research, quantitative methods, and  structured-decision making skills to understand system dynamics and help support wildlife management decisions in a transparent and inclusive framework. I have a B.S. in [Biological Sciences from Ohio University](https://www.ohio.edu/cas/biology) (2011), a Ph.D. in [Ecology from Auburn University](http://www.auburn.edu/cosam/departments/biology/) (2017), and post-doctoral experience from the Alabama and Florida Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Units at both [Auburn University](https://www1.usgs.gov/coopunits/unit/Alabama) and the [University of Florida](https://wec.ifas.ufl.edu/coop/). 

I previously worked as an **Ecologist** for the [U.S. Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/) at the [Fort Collins Science Center](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/fort), where I built models and tools to support management decisions for wild horse populations in the United States. A key product I developed was [*PopEquus*](https://rconnect.usgs.gov/popequus/), a website application that can simulate wild horse populations and help understand trade-offs among management alternatives.

I currently am a **Lead Scientist** at [Conservation Science Partners](https://csp-inc.org), where I work on a team developing science products to understand population dynamics and support management decisions for Mojave desert tortoises in the western United States. We are using a **co-production** approach to iteratively engage experts, stakeholders, and land managers while building products, so that they will be most **useful** for management decisions.

On this site, you can learn about my [work interests](https://brianfolt.github.io/research), where my [projects occur](https://brianfolt.github.io/locations), and [products and publications ](https://brianfolt.github.io/publications) that have emerged from my work.
